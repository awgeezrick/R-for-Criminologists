##General instructions

For all activities you are expected to produce Word document files with the discussed answers and the relevant code. You need to generate a markdown document and use `knitr` to generate the html file with your answer. Create one html file for each weekly submission. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-apyD5f9nwg) explains how to do this. The video uses an earlier version of `rmarkdown`, so you will notice that when you create a new markdown file instead a dialog box open (select html) and you won't see in the working directory any reference to a .md file. Everything else pretty much remains the same. In any case, you can find further details about `rmarkdown` [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). Althouhg it may take you a while to get used to produce your homework in this way, in the long run you will see the benefits.

Then you need to upload the file to Turnit In through Blackboard.

##Week 1: Basic Data Exploration and Filtering

###Part 1:
Create a data frame with the points achieved by all the Premiership teams in the 2013-2014 season. You can find the relevant information [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_Premier_League).
1) What was the mean value of points for all the teams?
2) Using the filtering methods describe compute the mean (and standard deviation) for the 4 top teams and compare it with the mean (and the standard deviation) of the remainder teams.

###Part 2:
Load the `Arrests` data available from the `effects` package.

1) How many variables and cases does this dataset have? Tip: `dim()`
2) What are the names of the variables? Tip: `names()`
3) What does the variable `checks` measures? Tip: `help()`
4) Produce a simple histogram of the `checks` variable. Any discernible patterns? *Discuss*.
5) Produce summary statistics of the `checks` variable by `colour`. Any discernible patterns? *Discuss*.

##Week 2: Basic visualisations

Download from the GitHub repository the following dataset `crossnat`. This file contains a number of variables about 194 countries. I put together this file for teaching purposes in January 2014. The information comes from a variety of sources (World Bank, United Nations, OCDE, etc) and it relates to the more recent year for which data was available then.

1) Display a histogram for the homicide rate per 100,000 population (`homicide`). Discuss. Try to identify the identify of any outliers and discuss. Are these errors? Are there plausible explanations for the extreme values in these countries? 
2) Produce density estimates and boxplots to compare the homicide rate according to various categories of the level of [human development](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi) per country. Discuss. 
3) Produce a scatterplot with a smoothed line to examine the relationship between `homicide` and `gdppercapita`. Discuss. 
4) Produce a scatterplot matrix to examine the relationship between `homicide`, `gdppercapita`, `urbanpop` (proportion of the population that lives in urban areas) and `prisonrate`(prison rate per 100,000). Discuss.
