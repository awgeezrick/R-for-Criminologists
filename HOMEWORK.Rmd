##General instructions

For all activities you are expected to produce html files with the discussed answers and the relevant code. You need to generate a markdown document and use `knitr` to generate the html file with your answer. Create one html file for each weekly submission. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-apyD5f9nwg) explains how to do this. The video uses an earlier version of `rmarkdown`, so you will notice that when you create a new markdown file instead a dialog box open (select html) and you won't see in the working directory any reference to a .md file. Everything else pretty much remains the same. In any case, you can find further details about `rmarkdown` [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) or in this [very detailed tutorial](http://galahad.well.ox.ac.uk/repro/?utm_content=bufferc4efb&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer). [This guide](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html#troubleshooting) helps you to test drive and troubleshoot common problems. Although it may take you a while to get used to produce your homework in this way, in the long run you will see the benefits.

Then you need to upload the file to Turnit In through Blackboard.

##Week 1: Basic Data Exploration and Filtering

###Part 1:
Create a data frame with the points achieved by all the Premiership teams in the 2014-2015 season. You can find the relevant information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_Premier_League). 

  1) What was the mean value of points for all the teams? 

  2) Using the filtering methods described compute the mean (and standard deviation) for the 4 top teams and compare it with the mean (and the standard deviation) of the remainder teams. 

###Part 2:
Load the [classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Michel_Guerry) `Guerry` data available from the `Guerry` package.

1) How many variables and cases does this dataset have? Tip: `dim()`
2) What are the names of the variables? Tip: `names()`
3) What does the variable `Prostitutes` measures? Tip: `help()`
4) Produce a simple histogram of the `Crime_pers` variable. Any discernible patterns? *Discuss*.
5) Produce summary statistics of the `Crime_pers` variable by `Region`. Any discernible patterns? *Discuss*.
