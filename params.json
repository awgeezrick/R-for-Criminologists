{"name":"Introductory R for criminologists","tagline":"Materials for learning R while learning basic data analysis","body":"### Welcome to the GitHub repo for Introductory R for Criminologists\r\nThis is the GitHub page where I store learning resources for R. The intended audience are criminology (or other social science) students. \r\n\r\n### Health warnings\r\nPlease beware that:\r\n* This page is still under considerable development (use with caution).\r\n* These pages simply aim to describe the essence of some techniques, they **do not** provide a comprehensive description of these techniques and tools and how to use them. \r\n* The handouts below use, among other data sets, a teaching version of the British Crime Survey that is available under a [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/). This dataset is \r\ndesigned to be a learning resource and should not be used for research purposes or the production of summary statistics. \r\n* This dataset (and others here) was obtained from surveys using complex survey design. Proper analysis would require more specialised techniques than those introduced here.\r\n\r\n### Lab sessions for learning R data analysis programming\r\n* [Week 1: Introduction to R](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_1_Introduction.html)\r\n* [Week 2: Graphics with ggplot2](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_2_Graphics.html)\r\n* [Week 3 Foundations for inference (confidence intervals)](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_3_Foundations.html)\r\n* [Week 4: Hypothesis tests (comparing means)](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_4_Hypothesis_testing.html)\r\n* [Week 5: Relationships between two factors](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_5_Crosstabs.html)\r\n* [Week 6: Linear regression](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_6_Regression.html)\r\n* [Week 7: Regression in the real world](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_7_Real_world_regression.html)\r\n* Week 8: Logistic regression\r\n\r\n### Complementary learning materials\r\n\r\n* Helpful video lectures and free online materials that can assist in following the previous lab sessions \r\n* Links to other R learning resources \r\n* A workbook for learning data analysis using the R Commander\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble or questions?
