If you need some motivation for learning data analytic tools you may watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_Jvspojow) by Prof. Gary King in how the data world is changing and if you are a somehow sceptical criminologist you may want to read [this](http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/2/417) by Prof. David Garland.\r\n\r\n### Health warnings\r\nPlease beware that:\r\n* This page is still under considerable development (use with caution).\r\n* These pages simply aim to describe the essence of some techniques, they **do not** provide a comprehensive description of these techniques and tools and how to use them. \r\n* The handouts below use, among other data sets, a teaching version of the British Crime Survey that is available under a [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/). This dataset is \r\ndesigned to be a learning resource and should not be used for research purposes or the production of summary statistics. \r\n* This dataset (and others here) was obtained from surveys using complex survey design. Proper analysis would require more specialised techniques than those introduced here.\r\n* We do not hold a degree on statistics. We are just applied social scientists that use quantitative methods. If you detect any errors, please let us know.\r\n\r\n### Lab sessions for learning R data analysis programming\r\n* Preamble for educators\r\n* Preamble for students\r\n* [Week 1: Introduction to R](https://rawgit.com/maczokni/R-for-Criminologists/master/Week_1_Introduction.html)\r\n* [Week 2: Graphics with ggplot2](https://rawgit.com/maczokni/R-for-Criminologists/master/Week_2_Graphics.html)\r\n* [Week 3 Foundations for inference (confidence intervals)](https://rawgit.com/maczokni/R-for-Criminologists/master/Week_3_Foundations.html)\r\n* [Week 4: Hypothesis tests (comparing means)](https://rawgit.com/maczokni/R-for-Criminologists/master/Week_4_Hypothesis_testing.html)\r\n* [Week 5: Relationships between two factors](https://rawgit.com/maczokni/R-for-Criminologists/master/Week_5_Crosstabs.html)\r\n* [Week 6: Linear regression](https://rawgit.com/maczokni/R-for-Criminologists/master/Week_6_Regression.html)\r\n* [Week 7: Regression in the real world](https://rawgit.com/maczokni/R-for-Criminologists/master/Week_8_Logistic_regression.html)\r\n* [Week 8: Logistic regression](https://rawgit.com/maczokni/R-for-Criminologists/master/Week_8_Logistic_regression.html)\r\n\r\n### Complementary learning materials \r\n* Helpful video lectures and free online materials that can assist in following the previous lab sessions \r\n* [Links to other R learning resources](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/resources.html) \r\n* [A workbook for learning data analysis using the R Commander](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/rcommander.html)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble or questions?
