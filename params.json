{"name":"Introductory R for Criminologists","tagline":"Materials for learning R while learning basic data analysis","body":"### Welcome to the GitHub repo for Introductory R for Criminologists\r\nThis is the GitHub page where I store learning resources for R. The intended audience are criminology (or other social science) students. If you want to know more about me you can see who I am [here](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/juanjo.medina/).\r\n\r\n### Health warnings\r\nPlease beware that:\r\n* This page is still under considerable development (use with caution).\r\n* These pages simply aim to describe the essence of some techniques, they **do not** provide a comprehensive description of these techniques and tools and how to use them. \r\n* The handouts below use, among other data sets, a teaching version of the British Crime Survey that is available under a [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/). This dataset is \r\ndesigned to be a learning resource and should not be used for research purposes or the production of summary statistics. \r\n* This dataset (and others here) was obtained from surveys using complex survey design. Proper analysis would require more specialised techniques than those introduced here.\r\n* I do not hold a degree on statistics. I am just an applied social scientists that uses quantitative methods and has undergone substantial statistical training during my PhD studies and since then. If you detect any errors, please let me know.\r\n\r\n### Lab sessions for learning R data analysis programming\r\n* [Week 1: Introduction to R](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_1_Introduction.html)\r\n* [Week 2: Graphics with ggplot2](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_2_Graphics.html)\r\n* [Week 3 Foundations for inference (confidence intervals)](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_3_Foundations.html)\r\n* [Week 4: Hypothesis tests (comparing means)](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_4_Hypothesis_testing.html)\r\n* [Week 5: Relationships between two factors](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_5_Crosstabs.html)\r\n* [Week 6: Linear regression](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_6_Regression.html)\r\n* [Week 7: Regression in the real world](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_7_Real_world_regression.html)\r\n* [Week 8: Logistic regression](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/Week_7_Logistic_regression.html)\r\n\r\n### Complementary learning materials \r\n* Helpful video lectures and free online materials that can assist in following the previous lab sessions \r\n* Links to other R learning resources \r\n* [A workbook for learning data analysis using the R Commander](https://rawgit.com/jjmedinaariza/LAWS70821/master/rcommander.html)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble or questions? Please email juanjo.medina@manchester.ac.uk. Please get in touch as well with any feedback. I have put many weeks of work developing these materials and in making them open. Your feedback, thus, is appreciated.\r\n\r\n###License\r\nLearning R for Criminologists by Juanjo Medina is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).
